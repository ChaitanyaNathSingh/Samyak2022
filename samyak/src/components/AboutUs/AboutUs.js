                        SAMYAK '22 is a national-level techno-management fest organized by the students of KL University. It is a two day festival filled with activities, events, workshops, student-performances that drive the students to experience the benevolence in being part of a synergy. The colors popping throughout, the theme-relevant artworks designed from scratch by the student teams, the elegance in student groups coming together after all the effort they put in until the day of the fest cannot be looked past. And 15, in the title, stands for the 15th make of the idea. A 15 year legacy, still burning bright and being passed down to the coming batches is a standing example of the camaraderie the students share even between the passing batches. It shows a great promise in terms of offering a unique experience to students through a plethora of events that strengthen their technical and all-round abilities.
